# SUPERHERO THROWDOWN

## MOTIVATION

Any fan of superhero movies and comics has at one point wondered who would win in a fight between their two favorite heros. Especially between DC and Marvel characters. We wanted to make a fun application where the user could pick their favorite super hero (regardless of corparate affiliations!) and battle it out against the mightiest of super villains.
